### Mem Perf Measurements
This code was written for an assignment with the purpose of measuring memory performance differences of CPU cache vs RAM.
This also tests the performance of a linked list and set data structure.

The takeaways:
- Using compact and sequential data structures is preferred.
- Cache misses have a big impact on performance.
- The taking advantage of CPU pipelining allows for massive speedups.
- Conducting measurements is relatively simple and gives interesting insights into performance.
